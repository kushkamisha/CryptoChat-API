# Crypto Chat
The purpose of the project was to develop a messenger as a mobile application for the iOS platform. The application is intended for consultants from any field and their clients but can also be used for chatting as an ordinary messenger. The payment is conducted utilizing transactions in cryptocurrency by which a consultant and a client can use the service without any trust in it or each other. As a result, the usage of microtransactions and blockchain technology enables removing a problem with trust in the consultancy field.

In order to ensure that the application runs successfully, it is enough to explain to its users the basic principles of consultancy providing (getting) through the service. The only things that the users have to know before they run the application are how to create an Ethereum wallet, to replenish it, and to transfer the funds to any other address.
